# Contribution Guide

A huge thank you for your interest in this project! Every contribution, whether it's an idea, a bug report, or a few lines of code, is valuable and welcome.

## Project Philosophy: A Modern Partnership

This project was born from a unique partnership: it was **architected and driven by a human**, but its execution was greatly accelerated by the **power of several Large Language Models (LLMs)** like Claude, Gemini, and others.

We see this not as mere assistance, but as a modern development model where human vision guides the efficiency of AI. We encourage contributions that share this spirit of innovation, experimentation, and effectiveness.

## How You Can Help

All help is welcome. Here are the best ways to get started:

### üêõ Found a Bug?

1.  **Check First!** Take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/RonanDavalan/projet_vosk/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2.  **Open a New Issue.** If the bug is new, please report it with as much detail as possible:
    *   Your Linux distribution and version.
    *   The exact steps to reproduce the problem.
    *   The full error message, copy-pasted into the issue.

### ‚ú® Have an Idea for an Improvement?

All suggestions to improve the tool are welcome!

1.  **Open a [new issue](https://github.com/RonanDavalan/projet_vosk/issues) to start the discussion.**
2.  Describe your idea and explain how it would benefit users.

### üíª Want to Contribute Code?

Fantastic! Here's how to proceed to ensure your contribution is smoothly integrated.

**1. Prepare Your Environment**

*   **Fork** the repository (create a copy on your own GitHub account).
*   **Clone** your fork to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT.git`
*   **Create a new branch** for your changes. This is essential to avoid working directly on `main`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

**2. Code!**

*   Make your changes. Try to keep the code clear, simple, and commented where necessary.
*   Be sure to test your changes to verify that they work and don't create new bugs.

**3. Submit Your Contribution**

*   **Commit your changes** with a clear message, **in English**. Using English and following a convention is a best practice for maintaining a clean history that is understandable by everyone. We use the "Conventional Commits" standard.

    *   For a new feature: `git commit -m "feat: add voice command for XYZ"`
    *   For a bug fix: `git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with microphone detection"`
    *   For documentation: `git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"`

*   **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
*   **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the main project's `main` branch. In the PR description, explain what you did and why.

## Code Style

The project follows the **PEP 8** style conventions for Python. Clean and readable code is as important as code that works!
